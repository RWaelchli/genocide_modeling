## General Introduction

Throughout human history there has always been violent conflicts between members of different ethno-religous groups. These events have often led to the death of many individuals. One very drastic example is the series of civil wars during the decay of former Yugoslavia. To possibly prevent such tragedies from happening in the future, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of those conflicts.

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

The model is made up of two categories of actors: civilians and soldiers. The civilians are further divided into three different ethnic groups. This is expansion compared to the model described in literature.

The only task of the soldiers is it to prevent inter-group violence from happening. They arrest civilians, which have attacked a member of the an other ethnic group.

The civilians will engage in aggression agains other ethnicities based on their perceived hardship, the perceived legitimacy of the other groups, their individual risk aversion, individual violence threshold and the estimated arrest probability.

In contrast to the reference model from the literature, the spreading of information about outbursts of violence and its effect on the perceived hardship and legitimacy will also be investigated. In our opinion changes in those variables due to previous developments is key for the propagation of the simulation. Distribution of information is always associated with a certain degree of error. The effect of this "noise" will be examined too.

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

What different dynamics do emerge, when a third ethnic group is introduced into the scenario?

What would be a realistic model for the effect of violent events and arrests on the individual perceived legitimacy of the other ethnic groups and the individual perceived hardship? What effect on the outcome of the simulation do such additional interactions have?

How can information spreading be incorporated realistically into such a model? What effect does uncertainty in the transmission of information on the outcome of the simulation?

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )
